Registration is free and can be completed via [email](mailto:hong-phuong.dang@centralesupelec.fr). Please indicate if you would like to present your work.

Contributions are welcome and should consist of a short abstract. There is no required format â€” it can be a two-page LaTeX document or a simple summary.

Depending on the number of contributions received, we may organize a poster session during the lunch break.

Travel expenses for invited speakers (plenary talks) will be partially covered by our sponsors.
