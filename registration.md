<!--<div style="text-align:justify; margin:0.5em; padding:0;">
We are pleased to launch a call for contributions. Those interested in presenting their work are invited to submit a title and an extended abstract (maximum 2 pages). There is no required format — it can be a two-page LaTeX document or a simple summary.

If you wish to contribute to the workshop, please send an email with the subject line "Workshop Contribution", including the title of your contribution, to <a href="mailto:aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com">aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com</a>

Contributors (authors and co-authors) may still register using a dedicated registration form, which has been sent to them by email.
If some co-authors have not received the link (e.g. when only the corresponding author’s email was provided at submission), they are invited to contact the organizers <a href="mailto:aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com">aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com</a> to obtain the registration details.

<div style="text-align:justify;margin-top:0.5em;padding:0;">
We kindly ask participants who have already registered but will not be able to attend to inform us as soon as possible, so that their place can be reallocated to other participants.
To cancel your registration, please send an email to <a href="mailto:aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com">aiwildwest.workshop@gmail.com</a> with your full name and the subject line “Registration Cancellation”.
